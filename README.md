# My Curriculum Vitae (Resume)

## Dependencies

1. LaTeX with the following extra packages: `fontspec` `geometry` `multicol` `xunicode` `xltxtra` `marginnote` `sectsty` `ulem` `hyperref` `polyglossia`
2. [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), the universal document converter.
3. UNIX-like environment with Bash-like shell.

## Getting started

**Note**: If you have sensitive information on your cv, you can create `.private` file. Add your sensitive information as follows:

```bash
export CV_PHONE="<private phone number>"
export CV_EMAIL="<private email address>"
...
export CV_PRIVATE_INFO=<something private>
```

If you define a string that starts with the `$` sign in cv.yaml, it will be replaced with the corresponding value defined in `.private` file.

1. Fill `cv.yml` with your personal details, work experience, education, and desired settings.
2. Run `make` to compile the PDF.
3. Tweak on `template.tex` until you're satisfied with the result.

**Note**: This template needs to be compiled with XeTeX.

## Available settings

- **`mainfont`**: Hoefler Text is the default, but every font installed on your system should work out of the box thanks to XeTeX.
- **`fontsize`**: Possible values here are 10pt, 11pt and 12pt.
- **`lang`**: Sets the main language through the `polyglossia` package. This is important for proper hyphenation, among other things.
- **`geometry`**: A string that sets the margins through `geometry`. Read [this](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Page_size_and_margins) to learn how this package works.
